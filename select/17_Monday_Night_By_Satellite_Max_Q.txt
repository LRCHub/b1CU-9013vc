You stained my chair
I stained your dress
People think we're brats
But I think we're pretty smart
CHORUS:
Monday night by satellite
I'm walking through your dreams
Life's so strange when we're together
But I feel like we're twins
Oh the will
To carry on
The time is short
But I have the time
(CHORUS)
If I were to spend my whole life over
I'd spend it with you
Monday night by satellite
I love you
Monday night
Monday night
Monday night
By satellite
