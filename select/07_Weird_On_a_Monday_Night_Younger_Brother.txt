"You may have noticed, that I'm not all there myself"
"But- but- but- but, but- but- but... Butter!"
"It was very, very, very rude indeed."
"Jam? Jam, I forgot all about jam."
"Yes, sure you want, it's nice to see."
"Mustard? Mustard, don't let's be silly!"
"But I don't want to go among mad people!"
