I got ketchup on my blue jeans, I just burnt my hand,
Lord, it's hard to be a bachelor man.
I got girls that can cook, I got girls that can clean,
I got girls that can do anything in between,
I gotta get ready, make everything right,
'Cause all my rowdy friends are comin' over tonight.

Do you wanna dance, hey, do ya wanna party,
Hey, honey, this is ole Hank ready to get the thing started.
We cooked a pig in the ground, we got some beer on ice,
And all my rowdy friends are coming over tonight.

Now my party pad is out in the woods,
It's a long, long way from here to Hollywood,
But I got some natural queens out on the floor,
And ole Miss Mississippi just walked through the door.

I got a little whirlpool just made for ten,
And you can jump out, and you can jump in.
You can do anything that you wanna do,
But oh, don't you step on my cowboy boots.

Do you wanna dance, hey, do ya wanna party,
Hey, honey, this is ole Hank ready to get the thing started.
We cooked a pig in the ground, we got some beer on ice,
And all my rowdy friends are coming over tonight.

Do you wanna dance, hey, do ya wanna party,
Hey, honey, this is ole Hank ready to get the thing started.
We cooked a pig in the ground, we got some beer on ice,
And all my rowdy friends are coming over tonight.
