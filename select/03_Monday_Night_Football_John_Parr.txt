Monday Night Football, ready for the game
Monday Night Football, been countin' down the days
Monday Night Football, sugar for my soul
Monday Night Football, sweet as rock and roll

(Hut!) Are you ready for it?
(Hut!) Get ready for it
(Hut!) Are you ready for it?
(Hut!) Get ready for it

Monday Night Football
Monday Night Football, ooh
Monday Night Football
Monday Night Football

Monday night, Monday night, yeah
Monday night, Monday night, mmm

Monday Night Football, ready for the game
Monday Night Football, countin' down the days
Monday Night Football, sugar for your soul
Monday Night Football, sweet as rock and roll

Runnin' back, under attack
Break away from the defensive pack
Zonin' in, feed him a drill
Number ten movin' in for the kill
Sack that, quarterback, I'm windin' back
Ball spinnin' 'round and 'round
Boom! Touchdown

(Hut!) Are you ready for it?
(Hut!) Get ready for it
(Hut! Hut!) Are you ready for it?
(Hut!) Get ready for it

Monday Night Football, ready for the game
Monday Night Football, countin' down the days
Monday Night Football, sugar for my soul
Monday Night Football, sweet as rock and roll

Monday Night Football
Monday Night Football
Yeah, Monday Night Football
Monday Night Football

That's what I'm talkin' about
