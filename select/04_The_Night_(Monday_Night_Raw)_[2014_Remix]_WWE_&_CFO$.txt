You're Now tuned in to the world greatest
Tonight is the night
Bright lights, hype crowd
Yeah, we came to throw down
Everybody get loud
Tonight is the night
A-list, can't miss
When we burn it to the ground
Everybody get down
Tonight is the night
We stayed grinding while our fame kept rising
Steady climbing, now we on top
It's not something you get, it's just something we got
Cause I don't know if you know
If you know we playing or not, tonight
Lights flashing
When we step in the place
And you can feel the raw excitement
From the look on their face
It's like the prize right in front of my eyes to take
And the sky's the limit, got no time to waste
Tonight's the big go
Strike quick but creep slow
The competition is absent
The moment that we show
Count down from 3 go
Press X to reload
Yet they still try to topple the kingdom that we own
Outnumbered but outgunning
We're fearless and crowd stunning
Never an error on record
There's no one to protect ya'
And we would still be right here
If all the money was burned
But we stay bumping in your ear
Cause the money was earned, yo
You can find us climbing setting the bar
Or you could find us red carpet when we hitting it hard
Cause the truth is you can find us wherever you are
Just look up, we're flying high with the stars cause...
Tonight is the night
Bright lights, hype crowd
Yeah, we came to throw down
Everybody get loud
Tonight is the night
A-list, can't miss
When we burn it to the ground
Everybody get down
Tonight is the night
We stayed grinding while our fame kept rising
Steady climbing, now we on top
It's not something you get, it's just something we got
Cause I don't know if you know
If you know we playing or not, tonight
